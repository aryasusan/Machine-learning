Support Vector Machine (SVM)	
	- used for classification supervised algo
	- mainly for binary and image classification-
		binary classification: 0/1, True/False, Yes/No 
		image classification- mainly used by deep learning but ML can also be used

Linearly separable line: is drawn to differentiate various areas, machine choses that one which is of maximum distance from both areas. refer image SVM_linearly_separable_line.png
in that image line B will be selected.

Hyper plain: linear separable line will be enclosed using a plane
Support Vector: the points that is touched in the hyper plane. 

refer images hyperplane and linearline
