Regression Model:

	- to predict a numerical data
	- eg: predict company stock market
		predict salary based on years of experience
	
Independent Variable: other variable
Dependent Variable : that variable which is to be predicted
eg, predict salary based on years of experience: independent variable: salary, depen var: yrs of exp

Simple Linear Regression Model:
	- only one independent and dependent variable column
	- eg: predict salary based on years of experience
		predict interest rate based on credit score
		predict rate of house based on square feet

	Steps:
		. A regression line will be drawn such that all points are connected. refer regression line.jpg
		. prediction will be based on this regression model
		. perpendicular lines will be drawn along x to meet at the regression line
		. perpendicular line will be drawn to Y axis from the regreesion line point and that will be predicted value. refer predicted value regression.jpg
		
	- the model works on y=mx+c   m:slope of the line, x:independent variable, c:constant or y_intercept on x
	- the difference between actual value and predicted value is called error
	- in regression model, the performance evaluation is based on errors
