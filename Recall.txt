Recall:
	- a performance evaluation method which gives more importance to False negative condition(1 as 0)
	- Consider a situation where m/c predicts covid negative as negative
					   		positive as positive
					   		positive as negative
					   		negative as positive
 Here , the most dangerous situation to the society is predicting =covid positive as negative. 
 In this situation Recall method is used to analyse the performance where the False negative condition is optimised

- Recall value inversely proportional to False negative

	Recall  =  TP
		  -----
		  TP+FN
