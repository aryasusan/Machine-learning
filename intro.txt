Machine Learning

- teaches machine new info so that machine can interpret those without human help when encountered
- based on data set
2 Types of pgming lang:
	- traditional programming: input>logic>output
	- ML programming: teaches both input and output

2 Types of ML:
	- supervised ML
	- unsupervised ML: will have only input samples and we generate o/p to each i/p and then perform supervised ML to predict
			: algo used is clustering which is grouping
			: real time eg: market segmentation- notifications send to reliance customers is based on grouping 

Supervised ML:
	-trains a machine with various inputs and corresponding outputs and create a model with algorithms to predict an output when encountered
	- algorithms:
		- decision tree
		- linear regression
		- random forest
		- logistic regression
		- naive bayes algorithm
		- support vector machine
		- KNN
	- 2 types of supervised ml algorithm:
		- classification: if data to be predicted is categorical data ie, to predict true/false , yes/no, 0/1
		- regression
	
		To predict a categorical data:
			-KNN- KNearest Neighbour
			-Naive Bayes algorithm

			-SVM Support vector Machine
			-Decision tree
			- random forest
