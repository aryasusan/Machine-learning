ML Steps:

irrespective of classification/regression 5 steps is followed:
	1. Data collection
	2. Data preparation and exploration
	3. Model Creation
	4. Performance Evaluation
	5. model improvement and deployment

Data Collection:
	Data Sources: GIT,Kaggle

Data preparation and exploration:
	- Exploration: Data visualisation
	- Preparation: Data preprocessing- data cleaning, missing data handling

Model creation:
	- training of data

Performance evaluation- accuracy,drawbacks of model

Model improvement: improve if any issues


Before model creation we separate the data set into and training data

Training and Testing Data:
	Training Data: the data which is used to teach the machine- 70% of data set is used as training data
	Testing Data: Data used to test the machine if it has learnt- 30%
	

Features:
	i/p feature/ i/p label: For supervised Ml, the input column is referred to as i/p feature/ i/p label
	o/p feature: the o/p column eg: species,sepal length,colour
	class labels: the o/p or the category to which is predicted eg:iris setosa,iris virginica
