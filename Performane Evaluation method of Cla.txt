Performance Evaluation method of Classification Algorithm:
	1. Accuracy Score
	2. Recall
	3. precision
	4. F1_Score

The above methods is based on a matrix.

Confusion Matrix:
	- has 4 technical terms
		- TP -true Positive
		- TN- True Negative
		- FP- False Positive
		- FN- False Negative
	-True Positive: 1 as 1 predicted o/p(y_pred) and actual o/p(y_test) is 1. eg, patient is diabetic and m/c predicted as diabetic itself
	-True Negative: 0 as 0 predicted o/p(y_pred) and actual o/p(y_test) is 0. eg, patient is not diabetic and m/c predicted as non-diabetic
	-False Positive:0 as 1 predicted o/p(y_pred)is 1 and actual o/p(y_test) is 0. eg, patient is not diabetic and m/c predicted as diabetic
	-False Negative: 1 as 0 predicted o/p(y_pred)is 0 and actual o/p(y_test) is 1. eg, patient is diabetic and m/c predicted as non-diabetic

eg: refer confusion_matrix.png		

The order of confusion matrix differs based on the number of predicted o/ps
commonly for classification algo, confusion matrix  will be 2*2 matrix =>  TP FP  =>	20 7
									   FN FP        3 10
