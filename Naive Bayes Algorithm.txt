Naive Bayes Algorithm:

	-Supervised machine learning algorithm
	-used for classification
	-based on probability
	-the classifiers works based on bayes theorem
	-bayes theorem works on conditional probability

conditional probability:
	-probability of an event based on another event
	-eg, probability of getting a red king from a deck of cards
	P(A|B) =  P(A Intersection B)
		 ---------------------
			P(B)


Bayes theorem:
	-probability of occurrence and non-occurrence of an event
	- P(A|B) = (P(B|A)*P(A)
		  ---------------
			P(B)

	P(A|B) -POSTERIOR PROBABILITY
	P(B|A) - LIKELIHOOD PROBABILITY
	P(A)- PRIOR PROBABILITY
	P(B) - MARGINAL PROBABILITY

3 Classifiers:
	- Gaussian: used when the data is continuous ie numerical datas
	- Multinomial: when data is discrete, when i/p has both object and numerical data
	- Bernouli: used for both discrete and continuous data
